This repository contains SQL scripts used to assess the performance of promotional campaigns conducted by AtliQ Mart during Diwali 2023 and Sankranti 2024. The analysis addresses several business queries, including identifying high-value products that were offered at discounted prices, evaluating the distribution of these promotions across different stores, and measuring the overall effectiveness of the campaigns in terms of incremental sales and revenue. The project also examines the performance of individual products to determine how the promotions impacted their sales and revenue.
